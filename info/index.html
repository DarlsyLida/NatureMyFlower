            <h1>FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CIRCUMCISION (FGM/C)</h1>
            <p>FGM refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of 
                the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital 
                organs for cultural or other non-medical reasons.</p>
            <p>Here in Kenya around 4 million, or one in five, women and girls have 
                been subjected to FGM. In some communities, this rises as high as 94 percent. 
                Although overall these numbers have declined over recent years, they remain much too high.</p>
            <p>In cultures where female genital mutilation is entrenched in tradition 
                and social norms, it takes real courage to speak up against it.</p>
            <p>Because female genital mutilation is rooted in gender inequality 
                and power imbalances, fighting it requires changing the cultural and social norms 
                that increase the risk of harm to women. This means addressing all other forms of violence 
                and harmful practices such as child marriage, as well as physical, sexual and psychological 
                violence occurring in the family, institutions and our communities.</p>
            <p>Religious leaders, elders, and other cultural gatekeepers hold the key to the abandonment of 
                FGM by entire communities. They can make public statements delinking female genital mutilation 
                from religious teachings and ethnic culture. Decrees from Council of Elders have outlawed the 
                practice amongst their ethnic groups, paving way for alternative rites of passage that honour 
                the rights and well-being of women and girls. In addition, religious and cultural leaders from 
                across the country collectively signed a commitment to support government efforts in ending FGM.</p>
            <h2>Types Of FGM</h2>
            <dl type="I">
                <li><b>Clitoderictomy</b> - Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce.</li>
                <li><b>Excision</b> - Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, 
                    with or without excision of the labia majora.
                    The amount of tissue that is removed varies widely from community to community.</li>
                <li><b>Infibulation</b> - Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with a covering seal.
                    The seal is formed by cutting and re-positioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora. 
                    This can take place with or without removal of the clitoris.</li>
                <li><b>All other harmful procedures to the female 
                    genitalia for Medical purposes</b> e.g. Piercing,
